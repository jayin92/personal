## About Me

Hi! I'm Jie-Ying Lee, a Computer Science undergraduate at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and former exchange student at ETH Zurich. I currently serve as a research assistant at the Computational Photography Lab under [Prof. Yu-Lun Liu](https://yulunalexliu.github.io/).

In Summer 2024, I interned with Google's Pixel Camera Team, where I integrated the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for mobile devices under [Yu-Lin Chang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0O9rukQAAAAJ&hl=en) and Chung-Kai Hsieh. My industry experience also includes positions as an R&D Intern at Microsoft and a Backend Engineer Intern at Appier.

**I'm planning to pursue a Ph.D. in 2026 and am actively seeking research collaborations.**

Outside the lab, I enjoy badminton, dance, and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/photograbear_/).
