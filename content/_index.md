## About Me

Hi! I'm Jie-Ying (Jay) Lee. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, advised by [Prof. Yu-Lun Liu](https://yulunalexliu.github.io/). I am also a Software Engineer on Google's Pixel Camera Team, where I develop camera machine learning algorithms.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. During my undergraduate studies, I was an exchange student at ETH Zurich.

In Summer 2024, I interned with Google's Pixel Camera Team, where I integrated the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for mobile devices, hosted by [Yu-Lin Chang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0O9rukQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Chung-Kai Hsieh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chungkaihsieh). My industry experience also includes positions as an R&D Intern at Microsoft and a Backend Engineer Intern at Appier.

I am actively seeking research collaborations.

Outside of work and research, I enjoy badminton, dance, and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/photograbear_/).

The approach introduces (1) depth-aware unseen mask generation for accurate occlusion identification, (2) Adaptive Guided Depth Diffusion, a zero-shot method for accurate initial point placement without requiring additional training, and (3) SDEdit-based detail enhancement for multi-view coherence.
