## About Me


Hi! I’m Jie-Ying Lee, you can also called me Jay. I am a computer science undergraduate student at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and currently a research assistant at the Comp Photo Lab, advised by [Prof. Yu-Lun Liu](https://yulunalexliu.github.io/). My research interests include 3D generation for scenes and objects, 3D reconstruction, and computer vision.

I am currently a Software Engineer Intern at Google, working on SAM on mobile devices. Before joining Google, I was an R&D Intern at Microsoft and a Backend Engineer Intern at Appier.

I will be an exchange student at ETH Zürich in the autumn semester of 2024.

**I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in 2026, and I welcome any potential collaboration opportunities.**

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, dancing, and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/photograbear_/).
