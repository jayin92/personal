## About Me

Hi! I'm Jie-Ying (Jay) Lee. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, advised by [Prof. Yu-Lun Liu](https://yulunalexliu.github.io/). I am also a Software Engineer on Google's Pixel Camera Team, where I develop camera machine learning algorithms.

Previously, I was an exchange student at ETH Zurich. My industry experience also includes positions as an SWE Intern at Google, an R&D Intern at Microsoft and a Backend Engineer Intern at Appier.

I am actively seeking research collaborations.

Outside of work and research, I enjoy badminton, dance, and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/photograbear_/).

The approach introduces (1) depth-aware unseen mask generation for accurate occlusion identification, (2) Adaptive Guided Depth Diffusion, a zero-shot method for accurate initial point placement without requiring additional training, and (3) SDEdit-based detail enhancement for multi-view coherence.

SpectroMotion is presented, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based rendering (PBR) and deformation fields to reconstruct dynamic specular scenes and is the only existing 3DGS method capable of synthesizing photorealistic real-world dynamic specular scenes.

This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFs to enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes, and identifies limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views.
